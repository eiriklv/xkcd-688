## XKCD #688
XKCD [#688] is meta -- it includes information about itself. Why not try and
recreate it?

Of course, there are certain inaccuracies. I didn't try and make the bars the
*exact* same width and the like. The last panel doesn't accurately portray the
comic, as the resolution isn't high enough. All that aside, this script works
in general.
